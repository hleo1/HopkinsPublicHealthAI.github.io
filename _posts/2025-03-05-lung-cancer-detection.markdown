While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as diagnostic support
tools for physicians, their inherent algorithmic biases and training data
limitations may affect diagnostic performance across different patient
populations


This study evaluates GPT-4o's diagnostic accuracy in identifying and
correcting misdiagnoses across the disease categories most prone to
diagnostic errors in the United States, while also considering the influence of
sociodemographic factors such as gender.

Checkout my code:

{% highlight ruby %}

#show misdiagnosis pythong code
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


## Conclusion:
Our findings reveal significant diseasespecific and gender-based biases in GPT4o's diagnostic assessments. These
results underscore both the potential
utility and inherent risks of implementing
this technology in clinical practice,
emphasizing the necessity for substantial
model refinement before widespread
clinical adoption. Future development
should focus on addressing these
systematic biases to ensure equitable
diagnostic performance across all patient
populations.
